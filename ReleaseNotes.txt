- Release: RT700SDK_EAR
- Version: SDK_1.10.0_RT700
- Date:    2024-07-02

--- CLNS memory consumption: delivery/mimxrt_release/static_library/mimxrt/libclns.a
TEXT RO RW ZI TOTAL_CONSUMPTION
129410 23832 0 0 153242

--- New Features 
   - Coverity (MISRA/CERT-C) violation reduction
   - Improved code coverage (of code shared with ROM deliverable)
   - Updated file structure (platform specific files are now located in platform specific folders, instead of manually merged with feature flags)
   - Memory aliasing workaround (translate addresses in 0x0000 0000-0x0078 0000 range to 0x20.. .... address range when passed to HW IPs)
   - Switched to Online_Code_Hosting License (removes clause 2.2/2.3 distinction as it allows distribution by default, even in source; still requires use in combination with NXP product)

--- Known Issues Limitations:
   - Coverity (MISRA/CERT-C) violations; Will be resolved in next release
   - AEAD oneshot decrypt operation (nxpClAead_crypt) produces full output block, instead of removing the padding; Will be resolved in next release; Workaround: allocate block-aligned output buffer
   - AEAD oneshot decrypt operation (nxpClAead_crypt) produces a tag as output, instead as taking it as reference input to validate the computed one; Will be resolved in next release; Workaround: provide a buffer for the tag output and compare it against the reference
   - Test failures when using data located in aliased memory; to be analyzed, can be test issue or missing CL adaptation for the memory aliasing:
      - HKDF tests
      - PUK import tests
      - EcVfy tests (internal_pub_key_interrupts_L2, els_shaDirect_224_and_els_eccVerify_L2)
      - EcKxch tests (external_pub_key_interrupts, internal_pub_key_interrupts)
      - Hash RTF tests
      - Some issues impacting communication (UART), preventing a proper FULL scope run
