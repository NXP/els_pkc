--- Test Target: FPGAv2 Cosim (RT700, Nirvana, Redfinch)

--- New Features 
   - Coverity (MISRA/CERT-C) violations resolved
   - Improved code coverage
   - Updated file structure (platform specific files are now located in platform specific folders, instead of manually merged with feature flags)
   - Memory aliasing workaround improvements (translate addresses in 0x0000 0000-0x0078 0000 range to 0x20.. .... address range when passed to HW IPs)
   - Switched to Online_Code_Hosting License (removes clause 2.2/2.3 distinction as it allows distribution by default, even in source; still requires use in combination with NXP product)
   - AEAD oneshot decrypt operation (nxpClAead_crypt) outputs correct plaintext size
   - AEAD oneshot decrypt operation (nxpClAead_crypt) verifies the tag instead of producing one

--- Known Issues Limitations:
   - Test failures for NIST SP800-108 KDF with HMAC_SHA1 on RT700
   - Test failures for RSA encryption padding on RT700
   - Not tested on Niobe4a
   - Only daily test scope executed for Nirvana, Redfinch and RT700
   - EdDSA verify bug still present!
