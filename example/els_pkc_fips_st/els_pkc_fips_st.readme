Overview
========
This application is executing tests on els_pkc cryptographic algorithms w.r.t. the NIST Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP).
Test vectors are being downloaded from the NIST website and parsed with a custom Python script, which creates the test vectors in C header
files. These C headers include the test vectors in valid format in order to execute them on the els_pkc library.
